# HSI-prediction
Predicting the HSI with time series model, neural network, and stochastic model

This project aims to predict the Hang Seng Index with the following model, 
time series analysis, the ARIMA model and the process of building the model, 
neural network the LSTM model and 
the stochastic model GBM,
with no previous experience in the mentioned method, 
this project provides me an opportunity to learning and applied my knowledge.

The detail will not be disclosed, as it is written in a submitted paper.
